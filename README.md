# A level Design Engineering project using Arduino

I created a "Smart" bin protoype using a proximity sensor, ultrasonic sensor and Arduino Uno. For this project, I used C++ and Arduino language commands to make a motor turn when the proximity sensor is able to detect the presence of a nearby object(such as my hand).

I used TinkerCAD for the circuit diagram simulation below
